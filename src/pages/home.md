# Hi, I'm Christian!

My girlfriend calls me "Brummefar". Currently I'm obsessed with JavaScript and Open-source software.

I work as a front-end developer at [Escenic](http://escenic.com/), spending most of my day fighting complexity in large applications for newsrooms.

One day, when I'm done hacking at a desk, I want to become a teacher of programming and web development.

In the meantime I use this website as an outlet to practice my ability to communicate various topics of computer science.
